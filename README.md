# font-ci-templates

Just a few basic CI (Continuous Integration) templates for open font projects using smith. 
So far: Travis, Bitbucket, GitLab, GitHub Actions... 

When applicable rename .dot to . and drop at the root of your project folder.
(Or in the expected workflow subfolder). 

There surely ways to improve the toolchain installation phase. 
Pre-build profile, caching etc. 
More on that later on. 

Adjust as necessary.

Enjoy
